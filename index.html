                <h1>Travel</h1>
                <p>Though I haven't been able to travel in recent years due to the pandemic,
                    I still very much love the idea of traveling. I love visiting countries/cities that are
                    very different from what I'm used to, to be able to experience other cultures, taste exotic food,
                    and enjoying what that country/city have to offer.

                <h1>Gaming</h1>
                <p>Video games are a great way for me to take off some stress off after a long period of
                    work. They can be either enjoyed by yourself or with others. Video games can also offer brilliant storytelling through
                    great writing and game design, able to bring out a storyteller's vision greater than any other medium
                    in certain cases.
